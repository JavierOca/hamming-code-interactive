# Hamming Code Encoder and Decoder

Web application that encodes and decodes binary strings using Hamming Code.

## Description
This project was developed as an academic work to demonstrate how Hamming codes are used for error detection and correction in data transmission.

The user can enter a binary sequence and generate the corresponding Hamming encoded message.  
The application displays the parity matrix used for the calculation, along with the original and encoded sequences.

An encoded message can then be modified manually and decoded to detect and correct possible errors.
